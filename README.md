# computational-model-of-synaptic_plasticity
This is the joint work of me with Professor David McLaughlin and Dr.Guanchun Li on the computational model of synapse plasiticity. We are investigating on the tristable model:Long Term Potentiation/Depression(LTP/D), basal state(Pi&Lisman 2008).
We apply previously recorded calcium dynamics model (Carlson&Giordana 2011) to stimulate the biochemical system in order to record the capture the biological phenomenon STDP(Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity) amd BTSP(Bi&Poo 1998)
